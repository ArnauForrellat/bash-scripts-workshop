#Design a script that receives the path of a directory and the name of the final tarball file.
#It must check if the directory exists and, actually, if itâ€™s a directory. If not, an error message must be displayed.
#If everything is correct, compress it in .tar.gz format with the specified name.
#If the file with the given name already exists, ask the user for confirmation before overwriting it. If the user denies it, close the script and show a message.
echo "Put a path of a directory"
read directory
